## The Many Hats Club presents #ISOLATIONCon

## I Recruit Hackers: Understanding your industry entry, your career and what matters.

My talk will be briefly about my non-linear entry into Infosec. It will focus on what matters when entering or transitioning into infosec, and then a bird's eye view of what a recruiter sees and does, and thus what is important to get noticed, get interviewed, and close a win-win offer!
