## The Many Hats Club presents #ISOLATIONCon

[Link to my talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjoCoxd2fTk&ab_channel=TheManyHatsClub)

## I Recruit Hackers: Understanding your industry entry, your career and what matters.

My talk will touch briefly on my own non-linear entry into Infosec. We will then focus on what matters when entering or transitioning into infosec, and then a bird's eye view of what a recruiter sees and does, and thus what is important to get noticed, get interviewed, and close a win-win offer!

##  What is ISOLATION Con

We are not just another infosec con; our vision is to be the online conference for information security people from all teams and different backgrounds all over the world. We actively want to encourage collaboration and participation. We want our Attendees and Speakers to be immersed in this online event, with activities and debates around the challenges we all face in our working and personal lives, and how they are adapting to the current situation we all face.

We are doing this with no charge to our attendees. Our objective is to raise money for good causes helping during this crisis. We have decided that we are going to raise money for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) aka Doctors without borders (UK, USA and International), they do great work all year round and especially now.

We’re now offering 3 online tracks for talks (Blue-team, Purple-team/Appsec and Red-team) with 3 fantastic Keynote Speakers Dave Kennedy and Tanya Janca, and Ray Redacted! We are also organising a CTF and have 2 great after-party activities; a pub quiz (hosted by TheBeerFarmers) and a special gig which we can now confirm is by ytcracker. We also have a meme competition track as well for some reason, don’t ask!

We are not advertising or providing sponsorship packages for this conference, though some organisations are offering to provide prizes for giveaways and contests to be run during the conference. Organisations and individuals that have donated a prize or equivalent will be shown throughout the con on holding messages at the beginning and end of each talk, and will be listed on the website.
