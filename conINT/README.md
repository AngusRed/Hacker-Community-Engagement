TALKS & WORKSHOPS
Whether you are an enthusiast looking to break in to the industry, or a seasoned law enforcement investigator, day 1 is an opportunity hone your existing skills, and learn new ones, in intelligence acquisition and analysis, investigations, and more with a full day of presentations and hands-on technical workshops hosted by The Many Hats Club.  

Every 40 seconds in the United States, a child becomes missing or is abducted.* The National Child Protection Task Force  and Trace Labs  help break the statistic by creating assistance , rescue and prosecution teams for missing person cases nationally to bring more kids home with the aid of volunteers and high tech techniques. We need to reach our 40k goal this October to fund more rescue operations and training resources for these amazing nonprofits who have already helped find hundreds of missing children and adults.
