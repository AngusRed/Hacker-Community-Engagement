## ABOUT THE INNOVATION CHALLENGE  

***THE AIM***  
Our aim is to drive innovation towards a more digitized and cyber safe Africa.  


Inspired by the XPrize Foundation, we believe that solutions can come from anyone, anywhere. We want to incentivise the solution and challenge the youth to solve it.  

***WHY WE'RE DOING IT***  
Lack of cybersecurity skills in Africa: There are currently only approximately 10 000 cybersecurity professionals on the African continent*

Digitisation drives the need for cybersecurity: Data breaches have grown by 500% during the COVID-19 pandemic  

We have an urgent need for strong cybersecurity response (CSIRT) capacities to protect citizens   

Lack of support for victims of online gender-based violence in Africa: 39.3% of African women concerned about their safety online.
